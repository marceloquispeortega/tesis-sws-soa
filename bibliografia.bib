  abstract = {The potential to achieve dynamic, scalable and cost-effective infrastructure
	for electronic transactions in business and public administration
	has driven recent research efforts towards so-called Semantic Web
	services, that is enriching Web services with machine-processable
	semantics. Supporting this goal, the Web Service Modeling Ontology
	(WSMO) provides a conceptual framework and a formal language for
	semantically describing all relevant aspects of Web services in order
	to facilitate the automation of discovering, combining and invoking
	electronic services over the Web. This document describes the overall
	structure of WSMO by its four main elements: ontologies, which provide
	the terminology used by other WSMO elements, Web service descriptions,
	which describe the functional and behavioral aspects of a Web service,
	goals that represent user desires, and mediators, which aim at automatically
	handling interoperability problems between different WSMO elements.
	Along with introducing the main elements of WSMO, the syntax of the
	formal logic language used in WSMO is provided. The semantics and
	computationally tractable subsets of this logical language are defined
	and discussed in a separate document of the submission, the Web Service
	Modeling Language (WSML) document.},

  abstract = {{The Semantic Web should enable greater access not only to content
	but also to services on the Web. Users and software agents should
	be able to discover, invoke, compose, and monitor Web resources offering
	particular services and having particular properties, and should
	be able to do so with a high degree of automation if desired. Powerful
	tools should be enabled by service descriptions, across the Web service
	lifecycle. OWL-S (formerly DAML-S) is an ontology of services that
	makes these functionalities possible. In this submission we describe
	the overall structure of the ontology and its three main parts: the
	service profile for advertising and discovering services; the process
	model, which gives a detailed description of a service's operation;
	and the grounding, which provides details on how to interoperate
	with a service, via messages.
	
	Following the layered approach to markup language development, the
	current version of OWL-S builds on the Ontology Web Language (OWL)
	Recommendation produced by theWeb-Ontology Working Group at the World
	Wide Web Consortium}},
